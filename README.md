resume.html
=========

A pretty resume written in HTML and CSS. [View it live here][1].

Based on the [Sample Resume Template][2] by [Matt Brown][3], 
which depends on Yahoo's YUI library for its grid layout, and
heavily redesigned by [Nate Tarrh][4].

resume.html has no external dependencies and a much cleaner 
stylesheet.
